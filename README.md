## The most original repository

### This is awkward
I'm here because I lost my prime directive

*But* I can still do the following:
- sleep
- eat
- procrastinate
- *when I absolutely must-*
  - write music
  - write stories
  - write code
  - make 3d art
  - make bad 2d art

### Thanks for reading
